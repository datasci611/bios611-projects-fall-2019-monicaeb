General comments:

Thanks for taking the time to look at my draft and give feedback! Your feedback was clear and well-organized.
Most of the feedback is just answering the feedback questions but doesn't really address the ideas I presented in my report draft.
The one 'meta' comment I found helpful was about discussing how to serve clients better.
