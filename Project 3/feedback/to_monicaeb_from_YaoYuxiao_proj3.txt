
Hi Monica,


Overall, your project3 draft has a good format and logic!



-------------Review of README-------------


The background is very clear to me.

However, it would be helpful to have more details to describe datasets used in the project.

Exploratory goals are clear and interesting, they make sense from the client’s point of view. 

Methods for the project provide a good outline.


-------------Review of Makefile and Dockerfile----------------

I didn't find your Makefile and Dockerfile

-------------Review of Python and R scripts----------------


The project uses both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts well.

Your codes are neat and readable!


-------------Review of html report---------------------


Various kinds of plots do a good job of analyzing and summarizing.

The interpretation of figures is clearly explained.

More details about background and datasets would be helpful.

I like your idea of exploring "Are some months more popular than others for new clients?". 

However, it would be better if underlying meaning of the seasonality hypotheses can be discussed.

Also, you may want to add more transistion paragraphs to show connections between questions.



-------------Review of codes--------------------



Your codes are neat and readable!




Good luck in final project!
