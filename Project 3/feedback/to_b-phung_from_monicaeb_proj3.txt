1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
- Not yet, but the README states that Make will be used in the final draft. I appreciate that you acknowledged this in the README so that I wouldn't have to go looking for it! 

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
- Not yet, but the README states that Python will be used in the final draft. Be sure to use Pandas when you do incorporate python.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
- Not yet, but according to the README, that's the plan. Be sure to indicate the right versions of software and packages when using Docker. 

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
- The plots aren't saved on github, so I ran your code myself. I think that the plot of zip code versus HPI doesn't tell us much as it is. I think there's an R package that converts zip codes to latitude and longitude--maybe measuring distance from UMD as a continuous variable would be easier to visualize (like in a histogram). Or just a simple bar chart of the most common zip codes and some description about the more obscure ones.
- It might be nice to label them as figure 1, figure 2, etc to make discussing them easier.
- To capture HPI, maybe you can take a look at some of the most common zip codes. projected HPI in the future could also be interesting if it's associated with a higher homelessness rate.
- To discuss plots in context and make them useful for UMD, I think your mapping idea will help to create a big picture for them. Try to remind your audience why it HPI of where clients come from matters.

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
- Make and Docker will help with workflow. When I ran your R code, I didn't already  have all the packages installed--make sure this is taken care of for the final draft.
- Project can be better documented with a more descriptive README. Add some context about UMD and your analysis steps to the results and/or README.

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
- Mostly. The data descriptions ("Notes") in the README are helpful to illustrate how the datasets are relevant to the analysis task. 

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the client’s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
- Knowing where people came from can certainly be useful, but maybe be more specific: how can UMD use the information about where clients came from? can they make any predictions or directly improve their services with the information you're summarizing?

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
- Yes, the links to online data sources are included and there is a data folder on github. It is clearly stated that the datasets come from UMD and what is in each of them.
- It's cool that you're also bringing in an external data source. Maybe add a statement about why HPI is relevant. 

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
- No interpretations yet in a report. When discussing the zip code plots, including the town/city name for each one will help give the audience context.

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
- Code is well-commented showing analysis steps, but there's no report yet.  

11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?
- Not yet, since there is no report, but goals are explained. 

General feedback:
- The README could be more useful if it contained an introduction to UMD to give the data some context.
- R code was nicely commented and easy to follow. 
- Having the plots already saved to github would have made reviewing easier--make sure they're in the report. 
- I think the concept of working with zip codes is very interesting! Try to add some explanation about why this information is useful to UMD. 
- What is the motivation for investigating housing price index and visitor frequency? What other related variables could be included in this question?
- I look forward to seeing your finished project! I find spatial data inherently interesting, so I'm glad UMD had zip codes for us and that someone is investigating them.
