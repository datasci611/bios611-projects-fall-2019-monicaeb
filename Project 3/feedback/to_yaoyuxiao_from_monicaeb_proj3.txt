Thanks for taking the time to provide feedback! I appreciate that you organized it into sections, but it didn't follow the format posted in slack.
The Makefile and Dockerfile are there, just don't have them working yet. 
Thanks for looking at my code too--it's good to know that it's readable!
I agree with your comment about the seasonality hypothesis. It will be helpful for me to add some meaning and context about that.
