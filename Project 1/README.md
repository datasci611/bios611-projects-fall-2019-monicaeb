#### Background 
[Urban Ministries of Durham](http://umdurham.org/) (UMD) has been helping end homelessness in the neighborhood for decades. Through a community shelter, cafe, food pantry, and clothing closet, UMD's efforts have touched and aided over 15,000 lives. 

#### Source Data
Raw data provided by the client includes 79,838 records with 18 variables and 15,352 distinct Client ID Numbers. This dataset is found in the *data* folder.
Variables describe food pounds, bus tickets, clothing, financial assistance, dates, hygiene kits, diaper distribution, and school supplies kits.

#### Questions to be addressed
How long do people tend to stay with UMD, and what is the typical number of services each person seeks?
During which times of year are new client numbers highest?
Which services may be particularly valuable as client numbers increase in the future?

#### Analysis approach
Through EDA, identify temporal trends in the data about number of clients served during different months and the average number of services or days per client.
Data cleaning will be performed to try to minimize erroneous data points and suspicious outliers so as not to thwart trends and detract from the bigger picture.

#### Scripts
eda.R contains data cleaning, variable creation, and plot drafts. 

#### Results
This folder contains the output html file and plots included in the final presentation.
