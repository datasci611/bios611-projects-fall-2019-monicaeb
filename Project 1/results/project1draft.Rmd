##### Monica E. Borges for BIOS 611

##### Goals of this analysis:
* To describe the growth that UMD has experienced in recent years
* To capture trends about when people are coming and going
* To capture visualize a need associated with increasing visitors: food supply


##### The number of people served at UMD has grown annually.

Plot of increase in clients by year

Plot of new clients by month

##### How many services do clients receieve, and how long do they "stay"?

Histogram of number of 'events' per client

Histogram of range of days between first and last visit

##### When do people have their last visit?


##### What happens around the last visit?
Nothing different from other events, actually. Food is overwhelmingly important! 

##### Food regression line
