#BIOS 611 Project 2 - UMD Part 2
### Monica Borges

#### Background
[Urban Ministries of Durham](http://umdurham.org/) (UMD) has been helping end homelessness in the neighborhood for decades. Through a community shelter, cafe, food pantry, and clothing closet, UMD's efforts have touched and aided over 15,000 lives. 

#### Source Data
Raw data provided by the client includes 79,838 records with 18 variables and 15,352 distinct Client ID Numbers. This dataset is found in the *data* folder.
Variables describe food pounds, bus tickets, clothing, financial assistance, dates, hygiene kits, diaper distribution, and school supplies kits.

#### Exploratory goals
* Allow static plots to be subset by year to increase level of detail
* Allow closer looks at specific clients, perhaps the activity of and services for those who have many logged visits to UMD
* By bringing in other data sources, compare UMD data with that of the area
